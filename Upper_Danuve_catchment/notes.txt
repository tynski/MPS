AIM
compute mean residence time of water -> tt

METHOD
my intuition is to check different tt, compute MSE and pick the tt associated with
the lowest error.

Calculation of the mean residence time of the water in upper Danube catchment using 
trial-error method



natural tracer - thritium

we will observe natural level and reduction of tracer, cycle in the nature 

trivia
during '60 thritium huge increas ivolved by bomb tests and then decresing

methodology:
convolotion integrel
1 constant one
2 ?
3 radioactive  decay

Piston-flow model
- advection phenomena (probobly not working correct)

Exponential model
- 

just definition we have to find t
t concetration / density of concetration 

recomend
numerical intergration

odady (input)
- time (months)
- tritum concetration (origination from percitipation)

dunaj (output)
- time (months)
- tritium concetriation

tt is set and checked if it is correct

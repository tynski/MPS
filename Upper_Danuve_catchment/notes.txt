natural tracer - thritium

we will observe natural level and reduction of tracer, cycle in the nature 

during '60 thritium huge increas ivolved by bomb tests and then decresing

methodology:
convolotion integrel
1 constant one
2 ?
3 radioactive  decay

Piston-flow model
- advection phenomena (probobly not working correct)

Exponential model
- 

just definition we have to find t
t concetration / density of concetration 

recomend
numerical intergration

odpady (input)
- time (months)
- tritum concetration (origination from percitipation)

dunaj (output)
- time (months)
- tritium concetriation
